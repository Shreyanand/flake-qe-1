**How Does it work?:**

**Data:**

Format:

The data that is input in a jsonl format. Each record in the input is a separate line. See test-example.jsonl.gz The following fields are required:

*   "status": String value of `"failure"`, `"success"`, `"error"` or `"skip"`
*   "test": Name of the test
*   "log": The full textual log of the test

Generating:

This merged PR indicates an automated means of producing a labeled training dataset:

**ML Process:**

Given a JSONL file in the form outlined above. We do the following:  

Use sklearn CountVectorizer to convert the log message into a 1xN vector where each position represents a word in the vocabulary and each value is the number of times that word occurred in the log message.

Then we use DBSCAN with a normalized compression distance (ncd) to cluster our training dataset.

K-nearest neighbor is then used for prediction to determine which class a new test log belongs to.

**How is a Flake determined?** It seems to me that it has something to do with a cluster's merge percent. If a point is labeled as failed, you use KNN to figure out which cluster it belongs in, and if itâ€™s matched with a cluster that has a merge percent higher than the flake threshold set in cluster.py, then it is labeled as a flaWas hard to find, butke.
